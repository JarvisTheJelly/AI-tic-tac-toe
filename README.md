## AI-tic-tac-toe
#### A test in Artificial Neural Networks where you teach an ANN to play the classic game of tic-tac-toe.

As a learning project to attempt to understand and use Artitifical Neural Networks, this program will take the simple game of tic-tac-toe, and attempt to teach and Artifical Neural Network how to play through playing against it myself.  

I think that perhaps I will attempt to teach it on bigger and bigger boards, and see if it can intuitively play without having to re-learn on a bigger board.  

for now, input in manual on both sides, and I am working on implementing the ANN now.
